![Demo Gif](https://gfycat.com/blandcarefreeblackbear.gif)
A team project which recreates the product description page of the popular website Etsy. Our team of 5 engineers broke apart Etsy's product description page into different components and we each took responsibility for one.  My component was the "related items" and "sponsored ads" sections of the page.

# Goals
Our goal was to take a popular website, in this case Etsy, and recreate the product description page as faithfully as we could both visually and functionally.  

# Workflow
We divided the page into different components and managed the team workflow using Trello.  We also used a shared database so we utilized Google Sheets to maintain a track a data set of 100 different products, then converted the .CSV file to a .JSON file which we used to upload to MongoDB Atlas.  

# Challenges
Taking a professional website as popular as Etsy and reverse-engineering their site was a challenge in and of itself.  There were many new technologies to learn during this project like Bootstrap and MongoDB Atlas.  I also had trouble replicating some of Etsy's animations they use on their page as I hadn't had much experience with animations prior.
