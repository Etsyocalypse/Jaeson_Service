# Etsypocalypse
A team project which recreates the product description page of the popular website Etsy. Our team of 5 engineers broke apart Etsy's product description page into different components and we each took responsibility for one.  My component was the "related items" and "sponsored ads" sections of the page.

# Component_Name: RelatedItems

# Table of Contents

# Goals
Our goal was to take a popular website, in this case Etsy, and recreate the product description page as faithfully as we could both visually and functionally.
